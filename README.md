# Exoskeleton

Just a tiny and revamped version of [skeleton.css](http://www.getskeleton.com/).

It weights *~10 KB* when minified, __and__ features the *latest (v4.2.1)* [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) [Reboot.css](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_reboot.scss) (with some minor tweaks)

## Disclaimer
After searching for a good css framework to kickstart a college project, I couldn't find anything that could fit my needs.
Small, concise, semantic and responsive. Most of frontend frameworks out there are just amazing, but overpacked at the same time,
and then i stumbled upon *[Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/)*, a very good starting point for small websites, but seems like it's abandoned *(the last commit was in 2014!)*

Remember that this is __NOT__ an UI framework, but a starting point for new websites. The same as Skeleton. 

> Please note that this project is foremost to fit my own needs, but i'll try to leave it as much *un-opinionated* as I can.

## Installation
Just drop the ```exoskeleton.css``` *or* ```exoskeleton.min.css``` file into your project and make the proper imports in your HTML file.
Both files are already compiled and ready to use.

## Usage
Damn... I need to write a proper documentation for this, but *right now* this is just a fork from Skeleton, so the same docs
applies. Check their [website here](http://www.getskeleton.com/).

## Compiling
If you want to build from source and overwrite a few things *(remember, it has been written in SASS using the SCSS style)*
of your own liking, just **run** ```npm install exoskeleton.css --save``` and import it in your project.
